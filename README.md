# Understanding-Income-Inequality-K-Nearest-Neighbor

Problem:

We have been given census data about attributes of US citizens (occupation, education, gender, race). With organizations working to ensure equal pay, we want to build a model to see how accurately we can classify low income from high income citizens. Building this model will allow us to understand which attributes contribute to affluency and how we can improve policies in the US.

Part 1:

Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data. This should be inclusive of all columns that needs to be modified due to errors/missing data.

Part 2:

Build a nearest neighbors model with the given data. Then do the following

How did you determine the value of K that you went with. What other values of K did you test with. How did different accuracy measures compare.
Do you believe the model is accurate enough to use in the real world.
Come to a final conclusion about the model. Discuss key learnings from Part 1 and the model itself. Here is where you should use facts from your research to have a concluding story about your work.
